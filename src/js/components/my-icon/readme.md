# my-icon2 (version 2)
The icon only takes in one (1) image, like written below. What you want to happen when you click the icon is up to you. but that happens OUTSIDE if the icon, and not within.
### How to use it:

 ``` html
 <my-icon2 class="icon1" > 
          <div slot="image">  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/250/000000/google-logo.png"> </div> 
  </my-icon2>`
```
  Make a div with the attribute `slot="image"` and then make an image element with the desired icon. <br/>
